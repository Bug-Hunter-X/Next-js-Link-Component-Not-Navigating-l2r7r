# Next.js Link Component Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js `Link` component where navigation to a new page does not function correctly.  The issue arises due to a missing or incorrect configuration in the Next.js application.

## Bug Description
The `Link` component, although seemingly correctly implemented, fails to redirect the user to the specified page ('/about').

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that the necessary routing configurations are properly set up within the Next.js application. This typically includes ensuring that the page being linked to ('/about') actually exists and that there are no conflicting routing rules.
